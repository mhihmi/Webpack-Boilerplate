# ðŸ“¦ Webpack Boilerplate

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Simple Webpack boilerplate with Sass, Babel, autoprefixer, postCss, and french comments to explain what's going on.
At this moment, I didn't include image-minimizer-webpack-plugin, because or vulnerabilities.
You can add regenerator-runtime if you're using fetch in your project.

Feel free to tell me if you find a way to improve this boilerplate.
